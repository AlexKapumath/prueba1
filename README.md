# Computing of Shintani fundamental domains
Here we give an algorithm to obtain a fundamental domain from a SIGNED fundamental domain for the action of the totally positive units group of a non-totally complex number field. Such signed domains were established in the works of Diaz y Diaz, Espinoza and Friedman.
