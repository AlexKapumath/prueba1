## Computing Shintani fundamental domains

Here we give an algorithm (in Pari/GP) to obtain a TRUE fundamental domain from a SIGNED fundamental domain for the action of the totally positive units group of a NON-TOTALLY COMPLEX NUMBER FIELD. We also present some examples of Shintani domains in the folder `Examples`. This implementation is based in the manuscript:

A.CapuÃ±ay, "COMPUTING SHINTANI DOMAINS" -- International Journal of Number Theory (2024)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SIGNED domains were established in the works of Diaz y Diaz, Espinoza and Friedman:

[DDF14] F. Diaz y Diaz and E. Friedman, "Signed fundamental domain for totally real number fields" (2014)  
[MR4105945](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3989)

[EF20] M. Espinoza and E. Friedman, "Twisters and Signed fundamental domains of number fields" (2020)  
[MR3198753](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07089)

Our implementation is also based in the description of rational cones by inequalities (or H-representation) and    
generators (or V-representation). For this we use the Fukuda-Prodon's paper:  

[FP96] Fukuda and Prodon, "Double description method revisited" (1996)  
[MR1448924](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61576-8_77) 
 


## FILE DESCRIPTION:


1. In the file `SignedDomain.gp` we implement the signed domains given in [DDF14] (for totally real fields) and [EF20] (for non-totally complex fields). Which can be read in Pari/GP using the command

     `\r SignedDomain.gp`

2. Using `SignedDomain.gp`, we give in the file `ShintaniDomain.gp` our main algorithm to find a true fundamental domain from a signed one. This can be read using 

     `\r ShintaniDomain.gp`

So given as input an irreducible polynomial `p` (which defines a non-totally complex number field), the command in Pari/GP

 `F=fudom(p);`

return a Shintani fundamental domain with the following structure:

 $$F:=[F_1,F_2,F_3];$$
     
The first entry $F_1$ (i.e., $F[1]$) has the form

 $$[t, p, reg, disc, [r_1, r_2], U, T]$$

with 

$t =$   real computation time for $F$ in milliseconds (this depends on the number of negative cones in a signed domain and 
       also on the type of processor used)
       
$p =$  irreducible polynomial defining a non-totally complex number field $k := \text{the quotient ring }\mathbb{Q}[X]/(p)$ of degree $n$
       
$reg =$ Regulator of $k$ to $19$ decimals

$disc =$ Discriminant of $k$

$[r_1, r_2]=[\text{Number of real places}, \text{Number of complex places}]$ signature of $k$, so $n=r_1+2r_2$

$U =$   fundamental units of $k$. The Shintani domain corresponds to the action on $(\mathbb{R}_{+})^{r_1}\times(\mathbb{C}^{\ast})^{r_2}$ of the group generated by $U$ (for $r_1>0$ and rank of units $r=r_1+r_2-1>0$). The units in $U$, like all other elements of $k$, is given as a polynomial $g$ in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ of degree at most $n$. The associated element of $k$ is the class of $g$ in $\mathbb{Q}[X]/(p)$
       
$T =$ number of semi-closed $n$-dimensional cones in the Shintani domain constructed. 


The second entry $F_2$ (i.e., $F[2]$) has the form

$$[C_1,C_2,...,C_T]$$

which is a list of the $T$ (semi-closed n-dimensional) cones in the Shintani domain. Here $T=F[1][7]$ is the last entry of $F_1$  described above. Each cone $C_j$ is given by $m$ linear inequalities ($m$ depending on the cone) giving $m$ closed or open half-spaces whose intersection is $C_j$. Thus, each $C_j$ has the form  

$$[v_1,v_2,...,v_m]$$

where $v_i=[w,1]$ or $[w,-1]$ and $w$ is an element of $k$ (depending on  $i$ and $j$). If $w$ is followed by $1$, then the corresponding (closed) half-space is the set of elements $x$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\text{Trace}(xw)\geq 0$. If $w$ is followed by $-1$, then the corresponding (open) half-space is given by $\text{Trace}(xw)>0$. Here Trace is the extension to $\mathbb{R}^n$ of the trace map from $k$ to $\mathbb{Q}$.

The third entry $F_3$ of $F$ (i.e., $F[3]$) has the form  

$$[CC_1,CC_2,...,CC_T]$$

where $CC_j$ is the closure in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of the cone $C_j$ in $F_2$. Each closed cone $CC_j$ is given here by a list of generators in $k$.



3. In the folder `Examples` we show several examples of explicit Shintani domains obtained using the `fudom(p)` command described in item 2. Here there exists 9 subfolders
 
$S[2,1]:=$[ShintaniK21](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK21)

$S[3,1]:=$[ShintaniK31](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK31)

$S[3,2]:=$[ShintaniK32](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK32)

$S[4,2]:=$[ShintaniK42](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK42)

$S[4,3]:=$[ShintaniK43](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK43)

$S[5,2]:=$[ShintaniK52](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK52)

$S[5,3]:=$[ShintaniK53](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK53)

$S[5,4]:=$[ShintaniK54](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK54)

$S[6,5]:=$[ShintaniK65](https://github.com/acapunay-math/CompShintaniDom/tree/main/Examples/ShintaniK65)

Each of these folders $S[n,r]$ respectively contain fundamental domains of some number fields of degree $n$ for $n=2,3,4,5,6$ with rank of units $r=r_1+r_2-1$ for $r=1,2,3,4,5$ such that $r_1>0$.

Each folder $S[n,r]$ contains three files, which we denote here as:`fieldsKnr.gp`, `ShintaniKnr.txt` and `ShintaniKnr-ML.sage` (Note the suffix $nr$ in the names of files fieldsKnr.gp, ShintaniKnr.txt and ShintaniKnr-ML.sage, where $nr$ means $[n,r]$. For example, if $[n,r]=[5,3]$ then the folder $S[5,3]$ contains the files: fields53.gp, ShintaniK53.txt and ShintaniK53-ML.sage)


Where:
    
* The file `fieldsKnr.gp` contains a data of fields used to obtains Shintani domains which was download from https://www.lmfdb.org/

* The file `ShintaniKnr.txt` contains a data of explicit Shitani domains which can be read by Pari/GP using the command 

   `\r ShintaniKnr.txt`
   
  This returns a vector called $examples=[E_1,E_2,...,E_g]$, where each $E_i=fudom(p)$ is a vector of size three which was described in item 2  with $p$ an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ which defines a non-totally complex number field $k$ with rank of units $r$.

* The file `ShintaniKnr-ML.sage` can be read by SageMath using the command 

  `load('ShintaniKnr-ML.sage')`

this returns the same list of examples as the file `ShintaniKnr.txt` with the same structure.

   
## SOME REMARKS: 

(1) After uploading files `SignedDomain.gp` and `ShintaniDomain.gp`, the command in Pari/GP:  `ShintExamples(L)` returns a file with a list of examples of the calculated Shintani domains, where L=vector of irreducible polynomials of degree $n$ (using $r_1>0$ and rank $r=r_1+r_2-1>0$).

(2) The fundamental domains in the folder $S[2,1]$ correspond to totally real quadratic fields which are widely known by number theorists. See for example Borevich-Shafarevich's Book "Number theory" (Chapter 5, Section 1.2).

(3) And the folder $S[3,2]$ which correspond to Shintani domains for totally real cubic fields are also known, see for example Diaz y Diaz and Friedman's work: [Real Cubic Shintani](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X12000844)

(4) On the other hand, the folder $S[3,1]$ contains Shintani domains for complex cubic number fields, this is consistent with a recently published work: [Complex Cubic Shintani](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793042123300016)

(5) The remaining files: $S[4,2]$, $S[4,3]$, $S[5,2]$, $S[5,3]$, $S[5,4]$ and $S[6,5]$ contains some Shintani domains (for a list of polynomials given) of non-totally complex quartic, quintic and sextic fields.

(6) The main bottleneck is that the number of cones on a Signed Domain grows (this is $3^{r_2}(n-1)!$ cones) when $n$ grows. This number of cones is the input in our main algorithm to obtain a Shintani domain, so our implementation works well when $n\leq 5$ and sometimes in sextic fields $n=6$ when the negative cones in a Signed domains is small. However, it is possible trying to compute Shintani domains of (non-totally complex) number fields for $degree>6$ if you are using a good processor.
