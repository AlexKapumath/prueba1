# Computing Shintani fundamental domains
Here we give an algorithm (in Pari/GP) to obtain a TRUE fundamental domain from a SIGNED fundamental domain for the action of the totally positive units group of a non-totally complex number field. This implementation is based on preprint:

A.CapuÃ±ay, "COMPUTING SHINTANI DOMAINS" submitted to the International Journal of Number Theory (2022)

The SIGNED domains were established in the works of Diaz y Diaz, Espinoza and Friedman:

[DDF14] F. Diaz y Diaz and E. Friedman, "Signed fundamental domain for totally real number fields" (2014)  [MR4105945]  https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3989

[EF20] M. Espinoza and E. Friedman, "Twisters and Signed fundamental domains of number fields" (2020)  [MR3198753]   https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07089

Our implementation is also based in the description of rational cones by inequalities (or H-representation) and    
generators (or V-representation). For this we use the Fukuda-Prodon's paper:   
 
[FP96] Fukuda and Prodon, "Double description method revisited" (1996)  [MR1448924]  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61576-8_77

File description:


1. In the file "SignedDomain.gp" we implement the signed domains given in [DDF14] (for totally real fields) and [EF20] (for non-totally complex fields).



2. Using "SignedDomain.gp", we give in the file "ShintaniDomain.gp" our algorithm to find a true fundamental domain from a signed one. Here given as input an irreducible polynomial "p" (which defines a non-totally complex number field), the command in Pari/GP:

     F=fudom(p);
     
returns a Shintani fundamental domain with the following structure:

      F=[F1,F2,F3];
     
The first entry F1 has the form

      [t, p, reg, disc, [r1, r2], U, T]

with 

t    = real computation time for F in milliseconds
p    = irreducible polynomial defining a non-totally  
       complex number field k := the quotient ring Q[X]/(p) of degree n 
reg  = Regulator of k to 20 decimals
disc = Discriminant of k
[r1, r2]= [#(real places), #(complex places)], so n=r1+2*r2
U    = fundamental units of k. The Shintani domain corresponds to
       the action on (R_+)^(r1) x (C*)^(r2) of the group generated by U (for r1>0). The 
       units in U, like all other elements of k, is given as a 
       polynomial g in Q[X] of degree at most n. The associated 
       element of k is the class of g in Q[X]/(p)
T    = number of semi-closed n-dimensional cones in the Shintani domain constructed 

The second entry F2 (i.e., F[2]) has the form

              [C1,C2,...,CT]

which is a list of the T (semi-closed n-dimensional) cones in the Shintani domain. Here T=F[1][7] is the last entry of F1  described above. Each cone Cj is given by m linear inequalities (m depending on the cone) giving m closed or open half-spaces whose intersection is Cj. Thus, each Cj has the form  

              [inq1,inq2,...,inqm]

where inqi=[w,1] or [w,-1] and w is an element of k (depending on  i and j). If w is followed by 1, then the corresponding (closed) half-space is the set of elements x of R^n with Trace(xw) >= 0. If w is followed by -1, then the corresponding (open) half-space is given by Trace(xw) > 0. Here Trace is the extension to R^n of the trace map from k to Q.

   The third entry F3 of F (i.e., F[3]) has the form  

              [CC1,CC2,...,CCT]

where CCj is the closure in R^n of the cone Cj in F2. Each closed cone CCj is given here by a list of generators in k.




3. We recommend seeing the examples in quartic fields given in "quarticexample_1.txt" (for a totally real quartic field) and "quarticexample_2.txt" (for a quartic field with one complex place).
