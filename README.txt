# Computing Shintani fundamental domains

Here we give an algorithm (in Pari/GP) to obtain a TRUE fundamental domain from a SIGNED fundamental domain for the action of the totally positive units group of a NON-TOTALLY COMPLEX NUMBER FIELD. We also present some examples of Shintani domains in the folder "Examples". This implementation is based in the manuscript:

A.CapuÃ±ay, "COMPUTING SHINTANI DOMAINS" -- International Journal of Number Theory (2024)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SIGNED domains were established in the works of Diaz y Diaz, Espinoza and Friedman:

[DDF14] F. Diaz y Diaz and E. Friedman, "Signed fundamental domain for totally real number fields" (2014)  [MR4105945]  https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3989

[EF20] M. Espinoza and E. Friedman, "Twisters and Signed fundamental domains of number fields" (2020)  [MR3198753]   https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07089

Our implementation is also based in the description of rational cones by inequalities (or H-representation) and    
generators (or V-representation). For this we use the Fukuda-Prodon's paper:   
 
[FP96] Fukuda and Prodon, "Double description method revisited" (1996)  [MR1448924]  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61576-8_77

FILE DESCRIPTION:


1. In the file "SignedDomain.gp" we implement the signed domains given in [DDF14] (for totally real fields) and [EF20] (for non-totally complex fields). Which can be read in Pari/GP using the command

     \r SignedDomain.gp

2. Using "SignedDomain.gp", we give in the file "ShintaniDomain.gp" our algorithm to find a true fundamental domain from a signed one. This can be read using 

     \r ShintaniDomain.gp

So given as input an irreducible polynomial "p" (which defines a non-totally complex number field), the command in Pari/GP:

     F=fudom(p);
     
return a Shintani fundamental domain with the following structure:

     F=[F1,F2,F3];
     
The first entry F1 has the form

     [t, p, reg, disc, [r1, r2], U, T]

with 

t    = real computation time for F in milliseconds 
      (this depends on the number of negative cones in a signed domain and 
       also on the type of processor used)
p    = irreducible polynomial defining a non-totally  
       complex number field k := the quotient ring Q[X]/(p) of degree n 
reg  = Regulator of k to 19 decimals
disc = Discriminant of k
[r1, r2]= [#(real places), #(complex places)] signature of k, so n=r1+2*r2
U    = fundamental units of k. The Shintani domain corresponds to
       the action on (R_+)^(r1) x (C*)^(r2) of the group generated by U (for r1>0 and rank r=r1+r2-1>0). 
       The units in U, like all other elements of k, is given as a 
       polynomial g in Q[X] of degree at most n. The associated 
       element of k is the class of g in Q[X]/(p)
T    = number of semi-closed n-dimensional cones in the Shintani domain constructed 

The second entry F2 (i.e., F[2]) has the form

              [C1,C2,...,CT]

which is a list of the T (semi-closed n-dimensional) cones in the Shintani domain. Here T=F[1][7] is the last entry of F1  described above. Each cone Cj is given by m linear inequalities (m depending on the cone) giving m closed or open half-spaces whose intersection is Cj. Thus, each Cj has the form  

              [inq1,inq2,...,inqm]

where inqi=[w,1] or [w,-1] and w is an element of k (depending on  i and j). If w is followed by 1, then the corresponding (closed) half-space is the set of elements x of R^n with Trace(xw) >= 0. If w is followed by -1, then the corresponding (open) half-space is given by Trace(xw) > 0. Here Trace is the extension to R^n of the trace map from k to Q.

   The third entry F3 of F (i.e., F[3]) has the form  

              [CC1,CC2,...,CCT]

where CCj is the closure in R^n of the cone Cj in F2. Each closed cone CCj is given here by a list of generators in k.



3. In the folder "Examples" we show several examples of explicit Shintani domains obtained using the "fudom(poly)" command described in item 2. Here there exists 9 subfolders (called "ShintaniKnr")

   ShintaniK65; ShintaniK54; ShintaniK53; ShintaniK52; ShintaniK43; ShintaniK42; ShintaniK32; ShintaniK31; ShintaniK21
   
Where each folder "ShintaniKnr" contains the fundamental domains for number fields of degree "n" (for n=6,5,4,3,2) with rank of units "r=r1+r2-1" (for 1<= r <=5 such that r1>0)

Each folder "ShintaniKnr" contains three files:

    fieldsKnr.gp
    ShintaniKnr.txt
    ShintaniKnr-ML.sage

Where:
    
* The file "fieldsKnr.gp" contains a data of fields used to obtains Shintani domains which was download from https://www.lmfdb.org/

* The file "ShintaniKnr.txt" contains a data of explicit Shitani domains which can be read by Pari/GP using the command 

   \r ShintaniKnr.txt
   
  This returns a vector called "examples=[E1,E2,...,Eg]", where each Ei=fudom(p) is a vector of size three which was described in item 2  with "p" an irreducible polynomial of degree "n" which defines a non-totally complex number field k. 

* The file "ShintaniKnr-ML.sage" can be read by SageMath using the command 

  load('ShintaniKnr-ML.sage') 

this returns the same list of examples as the file "ShintaniKnr.txt" with the same structure.

SOME REMARKS: 

(0) The commando in Pari/GP (after uploading files "SignedDomain.gp" and "ShintaniDomain.gp"):

      ShintExamples(L)
    
Return a file with a list of examples of the calculated Shintani domains, where L=vector of irreducible polynomials of degree n (using r1>0 and rank r=r1+r2-1>0).

(1) The fundamental domains in the folder "ShintanK21" correspond to totally real quadratic fields which are widely known by number theorists. See for example Borevich-Shafarevich's Book "Number theory" (Chapter 5, Section 1.2).

(2) And the folder "ShintaniK32" which correspond to Shintani domains for totally real cubic fields are also known, see for example Diaz y Diaz and Friedman's work: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X12000844

(3) On the other hand, the folder "ShintaniK31" contains Shintani domains for complex cubic number fields, this is consistent with a recently published work: https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793042123300016
